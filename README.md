# asset-division-worksheet
a web app version of a PDF form used by Massachusetts divorce attorneys to calculate division of assets among plaintiff and defendant. 

No frameworks used. Not even web components. Built using only HTML5, CSS, and vanilla javascript. PDF version of the form also in repo to compare against and test. 

To use the web app version of the worksheet, download "index.html", it's js and css files onto a directory and just double click the "index.html" file to open in a browser. 

You'll note the web app version is better performing, smoother navigation, and free of any calculation errors/glitches when changing/updating input values compared to the PDF form.
